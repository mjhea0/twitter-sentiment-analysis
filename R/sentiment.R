#' score.sentiment() implements a very simple algorithm to estimate
#' sentiment, assigning a integer score by subtracting the number 
#' of occurrences of negative words from that of positive words.
#' 
#' @param sentences vector of text to score
#' @param pos.words vector of words of postive sentiment
#' @param neg.words vector of words of negative sentiment
#' @param .progress passed to <code>laply()</code> to control of progress bar.
#' @returnType data.frame
#' @return data.frame of text and corresponding sentiment scores
